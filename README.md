wifi_bluetooth_killer

Turn off and disconnect Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, completely cutting off communication on your Linux to prevent packet injection attacks, which are passive attacks! With a vulnerable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth card, even when you're not using it, backdoors can be implanted in your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi! Disable on sensitive operating systems! To completely disable, do this through the BIOS, UEFI, or remove the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth cards!
This script operates at a lower level by interacting with the /sys filesystem, which allows for more granular control over the devices compared to using rfkill, which only controls the software-side state of the devices.
If you need more in-depth control and need to ensure the device is completely disabled, wifi_bluetooth_killer provides a more robust solution.
